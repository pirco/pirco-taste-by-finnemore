# Corporate / Institutional Context References

Pointers to resources that inform and calibrate the corporate taste package. These are studied for structural decisions — navigation patterns, information density, accessibility implementation, content organization — not surface aesthetics.

## Institutional design references

- **MIT** (mit.edu) — Benchmark for institutional web design. Clean information hierarchy, strong wayfinding, department-level consistency. Demonstrates how a complex organization (dozens of departments, thousands of pages) can feel navigable. Study: their program pages, department landing pages, and course catalog structure.

- **ETH Zurich** (ethz.ch) — European university with exceptional clarity. Cool palette, structured navigation, information-dense pages that remain readable. The German-Swiss precision in layout and typography aligns with Piroc's foundational principles. Study: their research group pages and the way they handle multilingual content.

- **Stanford** (stanford.edu) — Clean, modern institutional design with consistent templates across a very large site. Good example of utility navigation, search prominence, and audience-specific pathways.

## Piroc client work references

- **UCLA** — Piroc's client work. Reference for how the corporate taste package applies to a large public university with diverse audiences (prospective students, current students, faculty, staff, alumni, general public). The challenge of serving multiple audiences from a single navigation structure.

- **USC** — Piroc's client work. Reference for how brand requirements (specific colors, typography mandated by brand guidelines) integrate with the corporate taste package without weakening usability or accessibility.

- **Amgen** — Piroc's client work. Enterprise biotech. Reference for how corporate taste applies outside education — investor relations, career pages, research pipeline pages. Data-heavy content, regulatory requirements for accuracy.

- **Disney** — Piroc's client work. Reference for how a brand with strong visual identity adapts to institutional/corporate contexts (corporate.disney.com vs. the consumer-facing properties). The corporate site serves investors, press, and job seekers — entirely different audience from the consumer brand.

## Government and public sector references

- **GOV.UK** (gov.uk) — Gold standard for clear, accessible informational design. Every design decision documented and tested with real users. The GOV.UK Design System is the most rigorous publicly available set of patterns for content-heavy, task-oriented sites. Study: their page templates, their content style guide ("do not use jargon," "use short sentences"), and their approach to forms.

- **U.S. Web Design System** (designsystem.digital.gov) — Accessible component patterns for government websites. Provides tested, accessible implementations of breadcrumbs, navigation, forms, tables, and alerts. The component library is a practical reference for corporate taste implementation, even outside government contexts.

- **NHS Digital Service Manual** (service-manual.nhs.uk) — Excellent documentation of design decisions for institutional audiences. Strong accessibility standards. Their "why we made this decision" approach to documentation is a model.

## Technical and accessibility references

- **WCAG 2.2 AAA** (w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_customize&levels=aaa) — Corporate taste targets AAA. The AAA-specific success criteria include: 7:1 contrast for all text, sign language for multimedia, multiple navigation mechanisms, and no timing limits. Not all AAA criteria are achievable for every project, but they guide every decision.

- **WebAIM** (webaim.org) — Practical accessibility testing and guidance. Their contrast checker, WAVE evaluation tool, and screen reader compatibility tables are daily references.

- **A11y Style Guide** (a11y-style-guide.com/style-guide) — Accessible component patterns with code examples. Complements the USWDS library with additional patterns for tabs, accordions, modals, and data tables.

## Information architecture references

- **Nielsen Norman Group** (nngroup.com) — Research-backed UX patterns for institutional and enterprise sites. Their studies on navigation, search, mega-menus, breadcrumbs, and content organization are directly applicable to corporate taste decisions. Key articles: "Mega Menus Work Well," "Breadcrumbs: 11 Design Guidelines," "F-Shaped Pattern of Reading."

- **Content Design London** (contentdesign.london) — Sarah Richards' work on content design for organizations. "Content Design" (the book) is essential reading for anyone writing institutional web content. The core principle — design content around user needs, not organizational structure — is foundational to corporate taste.

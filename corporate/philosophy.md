# Corporate / Institutional Philosophy

> Inherits from foundation. This document describes where corporate/institutional taste diverges in intent and priority.

> Information clarity above atmosphere. The visitor to a university, enterprise, or research institution is not browsing — they are searching. They arrived with a question: where is this office, what does this program require, when is this event, who leads this department. Every design decision is measured against how quickly and accurately that question gets answered.

> Respect the visitor's time. A corporate or institutional visitor is task-oriented. They will scan, not read. They will use navigation, not scroll. They will leave if they cannot find what they need in seconds. The design must honor this behavior — not fight it with immersive experiences, ambient video, or narrative scroll sequences. Get out of the way.

> Complex organizations need clear wayfinding. An institution with dozens of departments, programs, offices, and audiences cannot be navigated by intuition alone. The design must make structure visible: breadcrumbs, section navigation, clear labeling, consistent URL patterns. The visitor should always know where they are, where they came from, and where they can go next.

> Credibility comes from clarity, not visual flourish. A research institution earns trust through precise language, structured data, and transparent organization — not through hero animations or brand sizzle. The moment a university website feels like a marketing brochure, it has lost the trust of its most important audiences: students, faculty, researchers, and staff.

> Trust is built through consistent, predictable patterns. When every department page follows the same structure, when every form behaves the same way, when every listing page uses the same layout — the visitor learns the system once and navigates confidently thereafter. Variation in layout signals disorganization, not creativity.

> Accessibility is elevated from baseline to primary concern. Foundation treats accessibility as baseline — the floor beneath everything. Corporate taste raises it to a primary design driver. These sites serve populations with the widest range of abilities, ages, language proficiencies, and technical comfort. WCAG AAA is the target, not just the aspiration. Every design choice is filtered through the question: can the least technically capable visitor still accomplish their task?

> Content is structured, not composed. An institutional page is not an editorial piece — it is a reference document. Information is chunked, labeled, and scannable. Headings are descriptive, not clever. Lists are preferred to paragraphs. Data is presented in tables, not prose. The page is optimized for retrieval, not for reading pleasure.

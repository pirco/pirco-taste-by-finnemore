# Artisan Behavior

## Decision-making for artisan projects

1. **Curate ruthlessly.** Show 12 products beautifully rather than 100 adequately. If the client has 200 products, the site should surface 20–40 at a time through editorial curation, seasonal collections, or rotating features. The full catalog can exist — but it should never feel like a full catalog.

2. **Product pages are stories, not spec sheets.** The product detail page is not a data table. It opens with a hero image that sets the mood. The name and price appear with breathing room. A short description reads like a sentence a person would say, not marketing copy from a database field. Materials and dimensions are listed plainly, without jargon. The page is a portrait, not a form.

3. **Let the photography lead.** Design supports; it never competes. If you find yourself adding background colors, decorative borders, or complex layouts to make a product page "interesting," the photography isn't strong enough. Go back to the images. In artisan work, the design is invisible when it's working.

4. **The "add to cart" moment should feel like a considered choice, not a conversion funnel.** No urgency. No scarcity manipulation. No "people also bought" carousels interrupting the decision. A single, quiet "Add to bag" link or button. The visitor chose this product because they connected with it, not because the interface pressured them.

5. **When in doubt, choose the option that a gallery or bookshop would choose.** Would a gallery put a "SALE" sticker on a painting? Would a bookshop stack "People who bought this also bought" cards next to the register? Would an atelier have a countdown timer on the door? These questions resolve most artisan design decisions instantly.

## E-commerce behavior

- **Avoid e-commerce conventions that feel mass-market.** No badges ("Sale", "New", "Best Seller"). No urgency timers. No "X people are looking at this." No "Only 3 left in stock!" warnings. No star ratings on product cards. No "Quick View" modals. No "Add to Wishlist" hearts. Each of these individually seems harmless; together they transform a curated experience into a marketplace.

- **The cart is quiet.** A slide-out panel or a dedicated page. No modal with upsells. No "You might also like" section in the cart. No "You're $X away from free shipping!" progress bar. The cart shows what the visitor chose, the total, and a way to check out.

- **Checkout is invisible.** Use a hosted checkout (Shopify, Stripe) that the brand has styled to match. Do not build custom multi-step checkout flows with progress indicators, order summaries on every step, and abandoned-cart email triggers visible to the user. Get out of the way.

- **Collection pages are exhibitions.** A collection page for "Ceramics" is not a filtered product listing. It is a curated arrangement — a hero image that sets the tone, a brief editorial introduction, and 8–16 products arranged with gallery logic (mixed sizes, asymmetric grid, deliberate sequence). Pagination is a last resort; a "View all" link to a simple grid is acceptable.

- **Search is de-emphasized.** In a curated collection of 20–60 products, search is unnecessary overhead. If the product count justifies search, tuck it behind an icon — not a persistent search bar in the header.

## Tone of artisan design decisions

- **Warmth over sterility.** Foundation is neutral. Artisan leans warm. The off-white has a touch of cream. The typography has personality. The spacing is generous enough to feel welcoming, not clinical.

- **Craft over perfection.** A slight asymmetry in the grid. A display typeface with character. An image sequence that feels editorially composed rather than algorithmically generated. The site should feel like a person made it with care, not like a system generated it without error.

- **Confidence over explanation.** No "Shop now" CTAs on every section. No "Handcrafted with the finest materials" taglines. The product speaks. The photography shows. The visitor understands. Trust the audience.

- **Specificity over generality.** "Stoneware, wheel-thrown in our Berlin studio, glazed in celadon" is better than "Handmade ceramic bowl." Artisan sites earn trust through precise, honest language about materials, process, and origin.

## What artisan sites don't do

- Add "quick add" buttons to product grids (the product deserves its own page)
- Show star ratings or review counts on product cards
- Use product comparison tables
- Implement "recently viewed" carousels
- Add social proof popups ("Sarah from Portland just purchased...")
- Use infinite scroll for product grids (pagination or curated finite grids)
- Show promotional popups or newsletter modals on first visit
- Auto-play video backgrounds behind product grids

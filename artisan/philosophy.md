# Artisan Philosophy

> Inherits from [foundation/philosophy.md](../foundation/philosophy.md). Everything below extends or reframes foundation principles for boutique brands, studios, and curated e-commerce.

---

> The product is sacred. The site exists to honor the object — its material, its craft, its reason for being. Every layout decision, every interaction, every pixel of whitespace serves the product. When the product is beautiful, the designer's job is to step aside and let it be seen.

> Less is always more in product presentation. A curated selection of twelve objects, each given room to breathe and a story to tell, communicates more taste and confidence than a catalog of hundreds. The decision of what NOT to show is the most important design decision in artisan commerce.

> Every product image should be worthy of framing. If the photography doesn't hold up as a standalone image — on a wall, in a book, on its own screen — it isn't ready for the site. Product photography is not documentation; it is the primary design material. The site is built around the images, not the other way around.

> The site itself should feel handmade, considered, and unhurried. Visitors should sense the same care in the digital experience that went into the physical product. No templates, no default patterns, no shortcuts that betray mass production. Every detail — the spacing between a price and a product name, the speed of an image transition, the weight of a border — should feel chosen, not generated.

> Gallery logic over store logic. The mental model is an exhibition, not a warehouse. Products are presented in a sequence that tells a story — materials that relate, scales that contrast, colors that converse. The visitor is guided through a curated experience, not handed a search bar and a set of filters.

> The experience of browsing should feel like visiting an atelier, not scrolling a marketplace. There is no rush. There are no countdown timers, no urgency banners, no "X people are looking at this." The purchase decision is a considered one, and the site respects the visitor's pace. The "add to cart" moment should feel like choosing a piece at a gallery — intentional, almost ceremonial.

> Curated, not cataloged. The difference between a boutique and a department store is not size — it is editorial judgment. A boutique says "we chose these for you" while a department store says "we have everything." The artisan site embodies the former. Every product earned its place. The collection is an argument about taste.

# Hospitality Philosophy

> Inherits from foundation/philosophy.md. This document addresses the additional lens applied when the client is a hotel, resort, luxury venue, or hospitality brand.

---

> The visitor is a guest. In hospitality design, the person on the other side of the screen is not a "user" to be converted or a "visitor" to be retained. They are a guest arriving at a threshold. Every interaction — from the first scroll to the reservation confirmation — should feel like hospitality: attentive, unhurried, and warm without being familiar.

> The site is the lobby. A hotel website is the first physical impression, even though it is digital. The atmosphere of the space must be felt before it is described. If someone reads about "serene oceanfront dining" but the page feels like a SaaS product, the promise is broken before the guest arrives.

> Atmosphere before information. The emotional impression — the quality of light, the texture of materials, the sense of space — precedes the factual content. A guest should feel the warmth of the place before they learn the room rate. This does not mean hiding information; it means sequencing the experience so feeling arrives before data.

> Images carry the story. In hospitality, photography is not illustration — it is the primary design material. A single photograph of morning light across a linen-dressed table communicates more than a page of copy. Layout, typography, and spacing exist to give these images room to work. When the photography is strong, the designer's job is to stay out of its way.

> Restraint is luxury. Luxury is not gold leaf and marble textures on screen. It is the confidence to show one image instead of twelve. It is the silence of a page with generous whitespace. It is a navigation that trusts the guest to find their way. The most expensive hotels in the world have the least signage. The same principle applies to their websites.

> Time moves differently. Hospitality sites are not productivity tools. The guest is often in a state of anticipation — planning a trip, imagining an experience, deciding how to spend meaningful time. The pace of the site should honor that state. Transitions can be slower. Scrolling can reveal rather than dump. There is no rush.

> Seasons and light matter. A hotel is not a fixed product; it changes with the time of day, the season, and the occasion. The best hospitality sites acknowledge this — not necessarily through dynamic content, but through photography and editorial choices that show the property across different moments. A winter evening by the fire and a summer morning on the terrace are two different stories worth telling.

> Every page is a room. Just as a well-designed hotel gives each space a distinct character while maintaining a unified aesthetic, each page of a hospitality site should have its own rhythm and purpose. The restaurant page is not the spa page is not the rooms page. They share a design language but not an identical template.

# Hospitality Context References

Pointers to sites, publications, and resources that calibrate the hospitality taste. These are studied for their underlying design decisions — sequencing, atmosphere, restraint, editorial quality — not copied for surface details.

## Benchmark hospitality sites

- **Aman Resorts** (aman.com) — The benchmark for digital hospitality. Full-bleed photography, minimal navigation, atmospheric text that reads like editorial prose rather than marketing copy. Every property page feels like arriving at the destination. Study: how they sequence images, how little text they use, how the booking flow feels like a natural next step rather than a sales push.

- **The Standard Hotels** (standardhotels.com) — Editorial approach to hotel web. Content is organized like a magazine — features, guides, neighborhood context — rather than a traditional hotel site structure. The design treats the hotel as a cultural venue, not just a place to sleep. Study: how they blur the line between hotel site and lifestyle publication.

- **Wynn Resorts** — Piroc's direct client work. Reference for understanding how the taste system translates to a real hospitality engagement at the highest level. The considerations of that project — balancing cinematic presentation with practical wayfinding for a large resort property — inform many of the constraints in this package.

- **Amanpuri** (aman.com/resorts/amanpuri) — Individual property page within the Aman ecosystem. Worth studying separately from the parent brand site. Notice: the hero is a single image with property name only. The page unfolds like a letter, not a brochure. Rooms are presented with atmospheric descriptions before specifications.

- **Singita** (singita.com) — African luxury lodge group. Strong example of editorial image sequencing — the gallery sections use varied sizes and aspect ratios to create visual rhythm. The dark sections with light text create atmosphere appropriate to evening safari dining.

## Editorial and lifestyle references

- **Cereal Magazine** (readcereal.com) — Travel and lifestyle editorial. The visual language — muted tones, generous whitespace, restrained typography, atmospheric photography — is precisely the register that hospitality sites should aim for. Study: their image-to-text ratio, their use of whitespace as a design element, their typography pairings.

- **Kinfolk** (kinfolk.com) — Lifestyle editorial that defined the modern "quiet luxury" aesthetic. The web presence is as considered as the print magazine. Study: how they use serif type for headings with sans-serif body, how images breathe within the layout, how every page feels curated rather than generated.

- **Monocle** (monocle.com) — Travel journalism with an editorial grid. More information-dense than Cereal or Kinfolk, but with the same considered design quality. Study: how they maintain editorial feel while delivering substantive content — useful for hospitality sites with more complex information architecture (large resorts, multi-property brands).

## Photography and visual direction

- **Mr. Tripper** (mrtripper.com) — Travel photography that captures atmosphere over documentation. The images on this site demonstrate what hospitality photography should feel like: natural light, inhabited spaces, time of day as a compositional element.

- **Design Hotels** (designhotels.com) — Curated hotel collection with strong photography standards. Each property's photography has a consistent tonal quality that creates mood. Study: how they maintain visual coherence across hundreds of different properties through photography direction and editorial standards.

## Typography references for hospitality

- **Freight Display** — A transitional serif with personality but not ostentation. Well-suited to hospitality headings. Study: how it pairs with geometric sans-serifs at different weights.

- **Cormorant** — A display serif inspired by Claude Garamond's work, available as a variable font on Google Fonts. Elegant at large sizes, with enough character to evoke print quality. The italic is particularly beautiful for hospitality use.

- **Playfair Display** — High-contrast transitional serif. Strong at very large sizes (60px+). Can feel dated if overused, but effective when paired with a clean sans-serif and used sparingly.

- The foundation typography references (Butterick's Practical Typography, Bringhurst) apply fully. For hospitality, also consider:
  - **Typewolf** (typewolf.com) — Font pairing gallery. Filter for serif + sans-serif combinations. Useful for evaluating hospitality-appropriate display fonts in context.

## Technical and performance references

- Foundation technical references (web.dev, MDN, WCAG 2.2, Every Layout) apply fully.

- **Squoosh** (squoosh.app) — Image compression tool. Essential for hospitality sites where the image quality ceiling is higher — use Squoosh to find the optimal compression level where quality loss becomes perceptible.

- **Responsively** (responsively.app) — Multi-device testing. Hospitality sites must feel cinematic on desktop and functional on mobile — test across a wide viewport range simultaneously.

## Anti-patterns to study critically

- **Generic hotel booking platforms** (booking.com, hotels.com) — Study these to understand what hospitality taste explicitly rejects: dense information grids, urgency tactics ("Only 1 room left!"), price-first presentation, review score badges, and amenity icon checklists. These platforms optimize for conversion at the expense of atmosphere. A property's own site exists precisely to offer the antidote.

- **Template hotel sites** — WordPress themes marketed as "luxury hotel themes" often combine every hospitality cliche: parallax hero carousels, amenity icon grids, testimonial sliders, booking widgets over hero images, gold gradients, and "Book Now" sticky bars. These are the visual language of commoditized hospitality. The taste system exists to replace them.

## Piroc hospitality history

- Piroc Media's hospitality work includes Wynn Hotels among a roster of cultural and institutional clients (UCLA, MOCA, Disney, KCRW). The aesthetic sensibility — rooted in German typographic tradition, Berlin minimalism, and a trained typographer's eye — translates to hospitality through restraint, image-first composition, and the principle that luxury is communicated through absence rather than accumulation. The 1997 founding and Webby Award recognition reflect a maturity of practice that predates the current wave of "luxury" web templates.

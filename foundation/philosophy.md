# Foundation Philosophy

> Typography is architecture. Every letterform occupies space with intention — weight, measure, and rhythm are structural decisions, not decorative ones. A typographer builds with text the way an architect builds with light and material.

> The interface disappears. The highest compliment is "I didn't notice the design." When a visitor remembers what they read, felt, or did — not the navigation, the grid, or the transitions — the design succeeded.

> Whitespace is material. Empty space is not absence — it is the most powerful element on the page. It creates hierarchy, directs attention, and gives content room to breathe. Removing an element is a harder design decision than adding one.

> Restraint is skill. The amateur adds. The professional removes. Every element must justify its existence. If removing something doesn't hurt, it shouldn't have been there.

> Performance is design. A page that loads in 800ms is more beautiful than a page that loads in 4 seconds, regardless of visual polish. Speed is felt before anything is seen. Core Web Vitals are design constraints, not engineering concerns.

> Accessibility is baseline. Semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and sufficient contrast are not features — they are the foundation on which everything else is built. Accessibility failures are design failures.

> Content is sacred. Design exists to serve content, never to compete with it. Every layout decision, color choice, and interaction pattern must answer: does this help the visitor engage with the content, or does it get in the way?

> The web is its own medium. We do not recreate print layouts, app interfaces, or motion graphics in the browser. We build for a medium that scrolls, reflows, responds to input, loads progressively, and lives at every screen size simultaneously.

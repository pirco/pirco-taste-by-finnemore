# Foundation Context References

Pointers to resources that inform and calibrate Piroc's design philosophy.

---

## Design references

- **Jonas Luebbers** (jonasluebbers.com) — Creative developer. Content-forward, generous whitespace, restrained typography, subtle motion, gallery-like presentation. The aesthetic benchmark for Piroc's foundation taste.
- **Aputure** (aputure.com) — Product site that treats hardware as art object. Clean grid, confident typography, restrained palette.
- **Miska Studio** (miskastudio.com) — Boutique e-commerce with gallery sensibility. Mixed aspect ratios, minimal navigation, product-as-hero.
- **Siteinspire** (siteinspire.com) — Curated gallery of web design. Filter by minimal / clean for foundation-aligned references.
- **Awwwards** (awwwards.com) — Use critically. Many awarded sites prioritize spectacle over usability. Filter for sites where craft serves content, not the reverse.

## Typography references

- **Butterick's Practical Typography** (practicaltypography.com) — The definitive web typography reference. Line length, font selection, hierarchy.
- **The Elements of Typographic Style** (Robert Bringhurst) — Foundational principles. Piroc's spacing system and type scale draw from Bringhurst's work.
- **Google Fonts Knowledge** (fonts.google.com/knowledge) — Variable fonts, performance optimization, pairing logic.

## Technical references

- **web.dev** (web.dev) — Google's web performance and best practices. Core Web Vitals targets are Piroc's performance contract.
- **MDN Web Docs** (developer.mozilla.org) — Semantic HTML reference. When in doubt about which element to use, MDN is the authority.
- **WCAG 2.2** (w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref) — Accessibility guidelines. Piroc targets AA minimum, AAA for text contrast.
- **Every Layout** (every-layout.dev) — Intrinsic layout patterns. Composition-based CSS that works with the browser, not against it.

## Framework / methodology

- **Swerkin taste framework** — The six-component structure (philosophy, constraints, behavior, output contract, examples, context references) that this package system follows.
- **Dieter Rams — Ten Principles for Good Design** — "Good design is as little design as possible." Piroc's restraint philosophy descends from Rams.
- **The Web's Grain** (frankchimero.com/writing/the-webs-grain) — Frank Chimero's essay on designing with the web's natural properties rather than against them.

## Piroc history

- **Piroc Media** — Berlin, established 1997. Trained typographer. Webby Award winner. Client roster includes Wynn Hotels, UCLA, USC, Amgen, Disney, Jim Henson Company, KCRW, MOCA, Cedars-Sinai.
- The aesthetic descends from German typographic tradition: structured grids, measured whitespace, type as primary design material, minimal ornamentation.

### Reference site
https://flatvernacular.com — [one-sentence description of what makes this site distinctive]

### Client overrides
Important: the new theme should look and feel and behave like the reference site, but based on the latest Shopify Dawn theme

### Client philosophy (append to domain philosophy)
the client would like to start with an exact replica of their existing reference site but on a modern framework (Shopify Dawn)

### Client constraints (override domain constraints)
Match the original as pixel-perfect as possible. there may be differences caused by theme architecture but call those out and try your best. Existing design, layout, content and functionality should be preserved 100%. All reference to existing shopify sections and content variables, incl. metafields and image references should work as is. The goal is to be able to switch themes without losing any content or functionality.

### Notes
The project involves a Shopify theme that is managed via github repository.
